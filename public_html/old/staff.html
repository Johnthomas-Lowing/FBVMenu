                                            <p>Greetings!  I prefer to be called Marie.  Alaska is and always will be my stomping grounds.  Semper fidelis to all my fellow Marines out there.  I have a multitude of passions from the outdoors to baking up a storm in the kitchen.  Vaping became a part of my life in 2013 when Fatboy Vapors opened right here in Anchorage.  Come on by and let's see what Vaping can do for you.</p>

                                            <p>Hello my name is Felipe -  one of your vapor gurus at the Fairbanks location.  Born and raised in Puerto Rico, moved to Alaska back in 1999 thanks to the U.S. Army. I fell I love with Alaska and decided to stay.<br><br>  
												After 20 + years of smoking in conjunction with 6 + years of smoking and chewing (smokeless tobacco) it was time for a change. I found a less harmful alternative to tobacco products and I have never looked back.  I love to Vape but more importantly I love to help others make the transition from the cancer sticks to a less harmful alternative!</p>

Hey there JC here.  I've been in the vaping scene for about four years so I've seen vaping grow from something relatively unknown to pretty much the most successful alternative to smoking.  I've tried most things from patches, gum, the little e-cigs you buy at the gas station, and finally landed on vaporizers.  I instantly switched over to vaping the day I first bought an Ego C-Twist.  
 <br><br>
I started working at Fatboy Vapors in January of 2014 and have had the privelage of watching Fatboy Vapors grow so much and helping customers finally kick their smoking habit.  I love you everyone here is prety much family and we do our best to treat our customers as family as well.  Aside from tinkering with vaporizers, atomizers and coils, my other hobbies include cars and bikes.  What better way to end a day of riding / wrenching on your car than enjoying one of our many eLiquids, eh?!</p>

I have been working at Fatboy Vapors since April 15th, 2014.  I started in Wasilla helping around that location to get it started up and then to permanently work at the Anchorage location.  Working at Fatboy Vapors is great - the atmosphere with the fun and great employees, it's just another home to me.  I love to vape, almost a lifestyle not a hobby.   I fancy vape tricks and intricate coil buildswith my spare related to vaping times. </p>

Hello! My name is Damian Guerrero. I was born an raised here in Anchorage, Alaska. I love vaping! I started vaping in 2013, and I want to help other people kick the habit of smoking, so I decided to work at Fatboy Vapors to teach and to inform people about this healthier lifestyle. Its a pleasure to see people come in to get started on vaping, then watch them progress to where they no longer smoke or desire to. Also hearing the stories of how long they have stopped smoking, how much better they feel, and the money that they save down this path is truly amazing. I love my job , I enjoy the customer relationships we build. Ain't no community better than the vape community!!! #vapefam </p>

After I experienced first hand how effective they are at overcoming cigarette addiction, I applied and was hired at my first vapor shop, where I became more invested in learning about how they work, how to fix them for people, how to make great coil builds, etc. It's both fun and gratifying working every day to help people overcome their addiction to tobacco, knowing that all I've learned in this job is leading them to longer and healthier lives.

                                            <p>My name is Andy, and I am an avid vaper. My interest in vaping, and vape products began when I was 19 years old. I was a pack a day smoker, yet I hated the habit of smoking. I hated everything about smoking. I disliked smelling like cigarettes, having diminished lung capacity, and waking up every morning with a sore throat from smoking. The one thing I loved about smoking was the nicotine. The only reason I didn't quit smoking was I loved the effect of nicotine. Around this time, the market for vape products was just starting to take off. I decided to buy my first e-cig and try it in place of smoking. I was amazed! Within a week of making the switch to vape, my lung capacity started returning to normal, I didn't wake up with a sore throat every morning, and best of all, I no longer smelled of nasty stale cigarette smoke. I never looked back. I began researching and finding all the best products on the market. I invested countless hours into learning how to build coils, and build box mods from scratch. I even learned how to make my own juice. I soon found an amazing outlet for all this vaping related energy, and it was working for Fatboy vapors. I get to help customers make informed decisions regarding if switching to vaping may be the right choice for them. If it is, I get to help set them up with devices and products that will best fit their needs. I find my work extremely rewarding!
